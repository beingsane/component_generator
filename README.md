This project has a dependency on the [iMatix/GSL](https://github.com/gbluma/gsl)
code generator. It bootstraps an entire component from a configuration file.
The goal is for this to be a way to write an entire component without duplicating
a lot of effort.

If nothing else, it should assist with starting new components.
